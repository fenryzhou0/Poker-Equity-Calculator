# Poker-Equity-Calculator
* Input 2 poker hands against each other and see what each's chance of winning are (Work in Progress)
* Eventually, I hope to build this project to take multiple hands as input and calculate equity for each hand
* Even further in the future, I want the program to be able to take ranges into acccount and calculate ranges against each other
* I also plan on incorporating AI to have this program guess at a player's possible hands based on past hands and how they played them.
